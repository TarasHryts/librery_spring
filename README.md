## <a name="information"></a>Project Information
This is a very basic functional library application, written in Java 
using plain Spring Framework with a 3-layer architecture (i.e. model --> service --> controller).
The model is described by Entities, that are mapped on tables in a MySQL relational database.
You are free to use it as a template for your own online library software. 
In current implementation you can add, remove and modify books, users, roles and authors, 
as well as rent books and return them. The application provides registration and login procedures.
